# threesixty
A wirelessly controlled LED propeller display. The project is split into two subprojects: the [canvas](https://github.com/nventuro/threesixty/tree/master/canvas) (the rotating LED display), and the [painter](https://github.com/nventuro/threesixty/tree/master/painter) (the remote controller, which draws on the canvas).
